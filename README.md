# CalculatorTheGame

This is a script that can resolve the mobile game "Calculator: The Game".

## Drawbacks

Since this is a prove of concept and every 10 levels or so, some new feature appears in the game, this script only resolves aproximatly 200 levels of the mobile game.

To resolve the higher levels we just need to add the new features to the script.
